# HuangRotation
This repository contains an example of the code written for data analysis during my first rotation project with Wei Huang, Department of Engineering. 

This code is to be used with the provided documents (ExampleBiosensorGrowthData, ExampleBiosensorLumData, and ExamplePlatePlan).
The first time user should be able to run the provided code if all four files are downloaded into the same directory.
The user can then make his/her own files and edit the code accordingly. IMPORTANT: all files must be in the .csv format.
